# Transistors
A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electrical signals and power. It is composed of semiconductor material, usually with 
at least three terminals for connection to an electronic circuit. A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor's terminals controls the 
current through another pair of terminals. Because the controlled (output) power can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can 
amplify a signal. Some transistors are packaged individually, but many more are found embedded in integrated circuits.
