# Introduction
The metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) is the most-important device for forefront high-density integrated circuits such as 
microprocessors and semiconductor memories. It is also becoming an important power device.

## Field-Effect Transistors: Family Tree
The MOSFET is the main member of the family of field-effect transistors. A distinction between the field-effect transistor (FET) and the potential-effect transistor (PET) is warranted here. A transistor in general is a three-terminal device where the channel resistance between two of the contacts is controlled by the third (MOSFETs have the fourth terminal as contact to the substrate). The difference between the FET and the PET is the way the control is coupled to the channel. As shown in the following figure, in an FET, the channel is controlled capacitively by an electric field (hence the name field-
effect), and in a PET, the channel’s potential is accessed directly (hence the name potentideffect). Conventionally in FETs, the channel carriers flow from the source to the drain, and the control terminal is called the gate, whereas in PETs, these corresponding terminals are called the emitter, collector, and base, respectively. The bipolar transistor is a good representative of the PETs.

A family tree of field-effect transistors is shown in the following The three first-level main members are IGFET (insulated-gate FET), JFET (junction FET), and MESFET (metal-semiconductor FET). They are distinguished by the way the gate capacitor is formed. In an IGFET, the gate capacitor is an insulator. In a JFET or a MESFET, the capacitor is formed by the depletion layer of a p-n junction or a Schottky barrier, respectively. In the branch of IGFET, we further divide it into MOSFET/MISFET (metal-insulator-semiconductor FET) and HFET (heterojunction FET). In the MOSFET, specifically the insulator is a grown oxide layer, whereas in the MISFET the insulator is a deposited dielectric. In the HFET branch, the gate material is a high-bandgap semiconductor layer grown as a heterojunction which acts as an insulator.

There are many ways to categorize the versions of FETs. First, according to the type of channel carriers, we have n-channel andp-channel devices. n-channels are formed by electrons and are more conductive with more positive gate bias, whilep-channels are formed by holes and are more conductive with more negative gate bias. Furthermore, it is important to describe the state of the transistor with zero gate bias. FETs are called enhancement-mode, or normally-off, if at zero gate bias the channel conductance is very low and we must apply a gate voltage to form a conductive channel. The counterpart is called depletion-mode, or normally-on, when the channel is conductive with zero gate bias and we must apply a gate voltage to turn the transistor off.

It is important also to point out the nature of the channel in more details. According to the following figure, a channel can be formed by a surface inversion layer or a bulk buried layer. The surface inversion channel is a two-dimensional charge sheet of thickness in the order of 5 nm. The buried channel is much thicker, comparable to the depletion width since when the transistor is turned off, the channel is totally con-
sumed by the surface depletion layer. In the FET family, MESFETs and JFETs are always buried-channel devices, while MODFETs are surface-channel devices.
MOSFETs and MISFETs can have both kinds of channels in parallel, but in practice, they are mostly surface-channel devices.

These two kinds of channels offer advantages of their own. Buried channels are based on bulk conduction and, thus, are free of surface effects such as scattering and surface defects, resulting in better carrier mobility. On the other hand, the physical distance between the gate and the channel is larger and also dependent on gate bias, leading to a lower and variable transconductance. Note that for depletion-mode devices, it is common to use buried channels, but theoretically, one can achieve the same goal by choosing a gate material with a proper work function to shift the threshold voltage to a desirable value.

## Basic Device Characteristics
As shown in the following figure, the basic device parameters are the channel length L , which is the distance between the two metallurgical n+-p junctions; the channel width Z; the insulator thickness d; the junction depth r<sub>j</sub>; and the substrate doping NA. In a silicon integrated circuit, a MOSFET is surrounded by a thick oxide (called the field oxide to distinguish it from the gate oxide) or a trench filled with insulator to electrically isolate it from adjacent devices.
