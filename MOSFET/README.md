# Introduction
The metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) is the most-important device for forefront high-density integrated circuits such as 
microprocessors and semiconductor memories. It is also becoming an important power device.

## Field-Effect Transistors: Family Tree
The MOSFET is the main member of the family of field-effect transistors. A distinction between the field-effect transistor (FET) and the potential-effect transistor (PET) is warranted here. A transistor in general is a three-terminal device where the channel resistance between two of the contacts is controlled by the third (MOSFETs have the fourth terminal as contact to the substrate). The difference between the FET and the PET is the way the control is coupled to the channel. As shown in the following figure, in an FET, the channel is controlled capacitively by an electric field (hence the name field-
effect), and in a PET, the channelâ€™s potential is accessed directly (hence the name potentideffect). Conventionally in FETs, the channel carriers flow from the source to the drain, and the control terminal is called the gate, whereas in PETs, these corresponding terminals are called the emitter, collector, and base, respectively. The bipolar transistor is a good representative of the PETs.
