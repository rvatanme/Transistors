# Introductioin
While in a MOSFET the capacitor is formed by an oxide layer, the JFET (junction FET) and the MESFET (metal-semiconductor FET) form the capacitor by virtue of a depletion layer in a junction; the JFET from ap-n junction and the MESFET from a Schottky (metal-semiconductor) junction. In the branch of HFET (heterojunction FET), a layer of high-bandgap material is grown epitaxially over the channel, and it is used as an insulator. Bear in mind that the conductivity of a material is fundamentally related to its energy gap. An insulator is characterized by having a large energy gap. Epitaxial heterojunction produces an ideal interface. Such technique is necessary when an ideal oxide-semiconductor interface is lacking, which is practically for all semiconductors other than silicon. Under HFETs, the high-bandgap material can be doped or undoped. With high-E, material that is doped, carriers from dopants are transferred to the heterointerface and form a channel of high mobility, since the channel itself is undoped to avoid impurity scattering. This technique is called modulation doping. When applied to the gate of an FET, the result is a MODFET (modulation-doped FET) which possesses some interesting features. When the high-E, material is undoped, the resultant device is called HIGFET (heterojunction insulated-gate FET). In this case modulation doping is not present and the high-E, material is used purely as an insulator. Such a device behaves in principle the same way as a MOSFET.

## JFET AND MESFET
Both JFET and MESFET have the advantage of avoiding problems related to the oxide-semiconductor interface in a MOSFET, such as interface traps and reliability issues arising from hot-electron injection and trapping. However, they have limitation on bias range allowed on the input gate. In comparison, the MESFET offers certain processing and performance advantages over the JFET. The metal gate requires only low-temperature processing compared to ap-n junction made by diffusion or implant-anneal sequence. The low gate resistance and low IR drop along the channel width is a big factor in microwave performance such as noise and f<sub>max</sub>. The metal gate has better control in defining short channel lengths for high-speed applications. It can
also serve as an efficient heat sink for power applications. On the other hand, the JFET has a more robust junction for higher breakdown and power capability. A p-n junction has a higher built-in potential which is useful towards achieving an enhancement-mode device. The higher potential also reduces the gate leakage for the same bias. The p-n junction is a more controlled structure whereas a good Schottky barrier sometimes is difficult to form on certain semiconductors such as some p-type materials. A JFET has more freedom for various gate configurations, such as a heterojunction or a buffered-layer gate, that improve certain aspects of performance. 

### I-V Characteristics
As shown in the following figure, both JFET and MESFET consist of a conductive channel provided with two ohmic contacts, one acting as the source and
the other as the drain. When a positive voltage V<sub>D</sub> is applied to the drain with respect to the source, electrons flow from source to drain. Hence the source acts as the origin of the carriers and the drain as the sink. The third electrode, the gate, forms a rectifying junction and controls the net opening of the channel by varying the depletion width. The rectifying gate is ap-n junction in the JFET and is a Schottky-barrier junction in a MESFET. The device is basically a voltage-controlled resistor, and its resistance can be controlled by varying the width of the depletion layer extending into the
channel region. Most JFETs and MESFETs are of depletion mode, i.e., normally-on with VG = 0, or threshold voltage VG is negative. Very often for JFETs, the channel is surrounded by two gates. For the Fig. below a, that would be a second gate from the bottom side. This type of structure can be bisected into two halves and the final result becomes half of the total values, in both current and transconductance.

We can divide the characteristic into three regions: the linear region where the drain voltage is small and ID is proportional to VD; the nonlinear region; and the saturation region where the current remains essentially constant and is independent of VD. As the gate bias becomes more negative, both the saturation current IDsat and the corresponding saturation voltage VDsat decrease. 

For deriving general I-V characteristic of JFET or MESFET, we assume that: 1) Channel doping is uniform; 2) The gradual-channel approximation is valid (ξ<sub>x</sub> << ξ<sub>y</sub>); 3) The depletion laye is abrupt; 4) The current gate is niglegeble. We start with the channel charge distribution which is related to the channel dimensions. The channel dimensions and its potential distributions under both gate and drain biases are shown in more details in the following Fig.
