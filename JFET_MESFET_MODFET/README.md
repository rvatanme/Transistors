While in a MOSFET the capacitor is formed by an oxide layer, the JFET (junction FET) and the MESFET (metal-semiconductor FET) form the capacitor by virtue of a depletion layer in a
junction; the JFET from ap-n junction and the MESFET from a Schottky (metal-semiconductor) junction. In the branch of HFET (heterojunction FET), a layer of
high-bandgap material is grown epitaxially over the channel, and it is used as an insulator. Bear in mind that the conductivity of a material is fundamentally related to its
energy gap. An insulator is characterized by having a large energy gap. Epitaxial heterojunction produces an ideal interface. Such technique is necessary when an ideal
oxide-semiconductor interface is lacking, which is practically for all semiconductors other than silicon.
