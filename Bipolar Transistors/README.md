# Bipolar Transistor
The transistor (contraction for transfer resistor) is  a multijunction semiconductor device. Normally, the transistor is  integrated with other circuit 
elements for voltage gain, cur- rent gain, or  signal-power gain. The bipolar transistor, also called the bipolar junction transistor (BJT), is  one of 
the most important semiconductor devices. It has been used extensively in high-speed circuits, analog circuits, and power applications. Bipolar devices 
are semiconductor devices in which both electrons and holes participate in the conduc- tion process. This is in contrast to the field-effect devices.

Thyristor is a closely related bipolar device that will be introduced. The basic thyristor has three closely coupled p-n junctions in the form of 
a p-n-p-n strcture. The device exhibits bistable characteristics and can be switched between a high-impedance "off" state and a low-impedance "on" state.
The name thyristor is derived from gas thyratron, which is a gas-filled tube with similar bistable characteristics. Because of the two stable state 
(on and off) and the low power dissipation in these states, thyristors are useful in many applications.

## General Structure of BT
An idealized, one-dimensional structure of a p-n-p bipolar transistor is shown in the following figure a. Normally, the bipolar transistor has three separately doped regions and two p-n junctions. The heavily doped p<sup>+</sup>-region is called the emitter (defined as symbol E in the figure). The narrow central n-region, with moderately doped concentration, is called the base (symbol B). The width of the base is small compared with the minority-carrier diffusion length. The lightly doped p-region is called the collector (symbol C). The doping concentration in each region is assumed to be uniform. It should be noted that the concepts developed for the p-n junction can be applied directly to the transistor.
